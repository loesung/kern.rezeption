libraries
=========

**IMPORTANT** You have to create some links in order to make it work.

1. `baum.js`, this is the library tree. It is treated in a separated repo, may
   be _http://github.com/loesung/util.baum_ .

   * Use `ln -s /PATH/TO/baum.js ./baum.js` to set up this link.
   * Or here is a not recommended way: download and copy all files under that
     repo here, make sure that `baum.js` is in the same directory with this
     readme file.
